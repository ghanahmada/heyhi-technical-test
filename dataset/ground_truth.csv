2.3 What Is Active Transport?,"Learning Outcome• Define active transport and discuss its importance as an energy-consuming process bywhich substances are transported against a concentration gradient, as in ion uptake byroot hairs and uptake of glucose by cells in the villi.Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are ofhigher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This meansthat the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Sucha process requires energy and is calledactive transport.1Humans store food to see them throughtimes when food is in short supply.Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attackstored food and make it go bad. One way ofpreventing this is to store food in strong saltsolutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups)(Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brineor syrups are used in food preservation.2An animal cell is placed in a concentratedsolution of sugar. Which substance will leavethe cell and which will move into the cell? What processes are involved?Let’s Practise 2.2Theory WorkbookWorksheet 2B"

Instead of consuming meatas a source of protein, they eat a lot more dairy (milk-based) or soy products.This is because proteins are essential nutrients and so alternative sources ofprotein must be consumed to ensure a healthy and balanced diet."
4.1 What Are Enzymes?,"Learning Outcome• Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in allmetabolic reactions."
Alert,"Optimum:mostfavourableAn enzyme is less active at low temperatures.At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme andsubstrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate moleculescolliding with the enzyme is very low.1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. Therate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding andfitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases therate of enzyme-substrate complex formation.2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active.For most human enzymes, theoptimumtemperature is about 40–45 °C.3"
Biological Catalysts,"Biological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found inliving organisms.For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water andoxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.potassium chlorate(VII)potassium chloride+oxygenWhen potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off.Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced.If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reactionis speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide:• allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and• speeds up the reaction.At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV)oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in thereaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst(Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boilingor by changes in the pH of the solution.In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures arerequired to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in thelaboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quiterapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carryout these reactions using catalysts calledenzymes."
Breakdown of Starch,"Starch in the foods we eat may be digested in our alimentary canal. Whenstarch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and theglucose molecules are released.The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylasecannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucoseby another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch givesglucose molecules (Figure 3.13)."
CHAPTER,Isn’t it amazing how the toughest stains can be removed fromyour favourite T-shirts after washing? It is not done with theaid of special powers. It is through “special powders”. A lot ofwashing powders available in the market contain biologicalcatalysts called enzymes. What are enzymes?

Cells and the Chemistry of Life,"Now, look at Figure 3.27. Do you agree with what is said here? Why or why not?1To test a food for presence of reducing sugars or proteins, cutthe food into small pieces or grind up the food with a pestle andmortar (Figure 3.25). This helps to break the cells and release thefood substances so as to make a concentrated solution for testing.(a)Place some crushed pieces of food in a test-tube. Add 2 cm3ofwater to the test-tube to dissolve the sugars and proteins in the food.(b)Decant the solution into another test-tube.(c)Perform Benedict’s or biuret test with the solution. (Refer toLet's Investigate 3.1 and 3.4 respectively.)2To test for starch, use the iodine test in Let’s Investigate 3.2.3To test for fats, use the ethanol emulsion test in Let’s Investigate 3.3."
Characteristics of Enzymes?,"Learning Outcomes• Explain the mode of action of enzymes in terms of an active site,enzyme–substrate complex, lowering of activation energy and enzymespecificity using the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis.• Investigate and explain the effects of temperature and pH on the rate ofenzyme-catalysed reactions.Figure 4.7Enzyme-based biological detergent"
Chloroplasts,"•Chloroplastsare oval structures found in plant cells (Figure 1.16).• Chloroplasts contain a green pigment calledchlorophyll.• Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plantsmake food (see Chapter 12)."
Connect,"Some COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at lowtemperatures for them to be effective. In some instances,the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as–70 °C.At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that couldbreak down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccineare literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need todesign, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain suchsub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers thatcan store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from theplace where it is manufactured to reach different countries.These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action.Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machinesthat work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients duringstorage and transport (Figure 4.14).Figure 4.14Storage of Covid-19 vaccine in freezersFigure 4.15Three people are discussing the effect of enzymes on silk clothing. What is your view?If a shirt ismade of silk and silk is aprotein, can the shirt bedigested by enzymes?I think it can happen,especially if the right enzymes areused! Since silk is a protein, it canbe digested by a protease. I’m notgoing to wear any silk!I don't thinkthat can happen. Manypeople wear silk. Moreover, silkis not a nutrient. So, how canit be digested?You have learnt how enzymes break down large molecules in food intosmaller molecules. Now look at Figure 4.15. What are your views on thestatements made by the three people?ABC"

Diffusion,"Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spillsa bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scentspreading through the living room.Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.Figure 2.1Diffusion of perfume particlesPerfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they becomea gas.The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. Theybump into one another and move about randomly.This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and yousmell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process calleddiffusion.What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point Brepresents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of asubstance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus,there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference canbe shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient.2431PhysicsWe learn that the randommovement of microscopicparticles is known asBrownian motion."
Diffusion Across a Membrane,"Figure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane.A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (thedissolved substances) to pass through it.Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sidesof the membrane.Figure 2.5Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particlesthrough a permeable membraneObservation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the bluecolour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the waterin the jar.2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate movedfrom a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration inthe surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenlythroughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then thedissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across themembrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across themembrane to the right side of the beaker.23"
Enzymes Are Affected by Temperature,Figure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction.Figure 4.10Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction
Enzymes Are Affected by pH,"Enzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in whichthey act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease inthe stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinalenzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary fromthe optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity oralkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH ofabout 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) oralkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, theenzyme is completely denatured."
Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts,"Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensionalglobular shapes.strong heatAcatalystis a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself beingchemically changed at the end of the reaction.Enzymesare proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up therate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.Figure 4.1Manganese(IV)oxide is an inorganic catalyst."
Enzymes Are Specific in Action,"Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementaryto the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds toits substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, hightemperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme andconsequently its function."
Enzymes Lower Activation Energy,"Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxideand water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In otherwords, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking downthe fat in the peanut seed.The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is calledactivation energy(Figure 4.2).Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energyrequired to start a chemical reaction. They lower the ‘height’ of the ‘hill’.This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemicalreactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering theactivation energy.For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbondioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 °C).ChemistryWe learn the effects ofcatalysts on the rateof reactions. Catalystsprovide pathways withlower activation energiesthat increase rate ofreactions. Enzymes arebiological catalysts."
Enzymes Speed Up Chemical Reactions,Enzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymesspeed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed tostart the reaction.
Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion,"The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussedon page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another dependson the distance between the two points. The distance through which asubstance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusiondistance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence therate of diffusion is higher.In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane inFigure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Forexample, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membranebut proteins cannot.Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen andcarbon dioxide move into and out of cells.Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place bydiffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygenand remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both thesescenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at ahigher rate."
Fats,"Fats are a type of lipid.Fats, like carbohydrates, are organic moleculesmade up of the elements carbon, hydrogen andoxygen. But unlike carbohydrates, fats contain muchless oxygen in proportion to hydrogen.For example, tristearin (beef fat) has the formula C57H110O6. Notehow little oxygen it contains in proportion to hydrogen.The proportionsof the elements that make up fats are not fixed, so there is no general formulafor fats.Fats can be animal fats or plant fats. Fats are commonly used as a storeof energy, especially by animals.Fats Can Be Broken Down into Fatty Acids and GlycerolFats can be broken down into simpler compounds such as fatty acids and glycerol. Refer tothe general equation shown in Figure 3.16.frozen oilFigure 3.15Theoil on the surfacechanges from liquidto solid when placedin the refrigerator.The reaction involves an enzyme. For example, when tristearin is broken down by the enzymelipase, stearic acid and glycerol are produced:three stearic acid molecules(an example of fatty acid)lipasetristearinglycerol+Figure 3.16A fat molecule breaks down into glycerol and fatty acid."
Function,"Enzymes are proteins,and hence are affectedby all the conditions thataffect proteins, such astemperature and pH. Theyhave optimal ranges oftemperature and pH."

Glycogen and Starch Are Stores of Glucose,"Plants store glucose in the form of starch.Animals cannot make or storestarch in their bodies. We get most of our carbohydrates from plants in theform of starch.In animals, the main store of glucose is glycogen. Hence, glycogen issometimes called ‘animal starch’. In mammals, glycogen is stored mainly inthe liver and the muscles (Figure 3.12).Figure 3.12Glycogen and starch as stores of glucoseFigure 3.13Digestion of starchGlycogen and starch are suitable as storage materials in cells because:• They are insoluble in water, so they do not change the water potential inthe cells.• They are large molecules that cannot diffuse through cell membranes, sothey will not be lost from the cell.• They can easily be easily broken down to glucose when needed, forexample, in tissue respiration.• Their molecules have compact shapes, so they occupy less spacethan all the individual glucose molecules that make up a glycogen orstarch molecule."
Golgi body,TheGolgi body(also known asGolgi apparatus) isshaped like a disc. It consists of a stack of flattenedspaces surrounded by membranes.Vesicles(tinyspherical spaces enclosed by a membrane) can be seenfusing with one side of the Golgi body and pinching offfrom the opposite side (Figure 1.12).The Golgi body:• chemically modifies substances made by the ER• stores and packages these substances in vesicles forsecretion out of the cell(b)Three-dimensional view of Golgi bodytubule of smoothendoplasmicreticulum(a)Colourised electron micrograph ofGolgi body (6 250×)flat spacemembraneWhat role do fats play inyour body?

How Are Enzymes Classified?,Enzymes are classified according to the chemical reactions they catalyse.For example:•carbohydrasesare enzymes that digest carbohydrates•proteasesare enzymes that digest proteins•lipasesare enzymes that digest fats (lipids)1 (a)What is an enzyme?(b)What are thetwotypes of reactions that enzymes catalyse?2The unripe fruit of the papaya tree contains a particular type ofdigestive enzyme that is often used to soften meat.(a)Infer the kind of organic molecule that this enzyme acts on.(b)Suggest how the enzyme may cause the effect of softeningof meat.3Red blood cells contain a common enzyme known as catalase.What do you think would happen if a drop of blood was added to asolution of hydrogen peroxide?Let’s Practise 4.1Theory WorkbookWorksheet 4A
How Are Enzymes Named?,"Previously, enzymes were simply named by the persons whodiscovered them. For example, pepsin (a type of protease) wasdiscovered and named by a scientist, Theodor Schwann(Figure 4.6), who was studying digestive processes. ‘Pepsin’means ‘to digest’ in Greek.However, naming enzymes this way led to a lot ofconfusion. Nowadays, enzymes are named according to ascientific system. The name of each enzyme:• shows the substance on which the enzyme acts• ends in ‘ase’For example, lipase refers to an enzyme that actson lipids."
How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?,"Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use lightand electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie vanLeeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to studymicroscopic objects!•Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken:one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)).•Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to takepictures. These pictures are calledmicrographs.•Light micrographscan come out as colour images.•Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can beartificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to makea section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).(b)Cutting a transverse section (T.S.)(i.e., cuttingacrossthe length of the cell)(a)Cutting a longitudinal section (L.S.)(i.e., cuttingalongthe length of the cell)(b)electronmicroscope(a)lightmicroscope"
How Can We Test for Fats?,"Theethanol emulsion testis a test for the presence of fats. A white emulsionis formed when ethanol and water are added to fats. Anemulsionis asuspension of small drops of a liquid in another liquid.AimTo test for the presence of fats in food samples using theethanol emulsion testProcedure1On samples in liquid state (e.g. coconut oil):(a)Add 2 cm3of ethanol to a drop of liquid sample in atest-tube and shake the mixture thoroughly.(b)Add 2 cm3of water to the mixture and shake the mixture.(c)Record your observation.2On samples in solid state (e.g. peanut):(a)Crush the solid sample into small pieces using amortar and pestle and place the pieces in a test-tube.(b)Add 2 cm3of ethanol into the test-tube and shakethoroughly.(c)Allow the solid particles to settle. Carefully decant theethanol (pour off the top layer of ethanol) into another test-tubecontaining 2 cm3of water and shake the mixture.(d)Record your observation.ObservationThe white emulsion produced indicates the presence of fats (Figure 3.19).Let’s Investigate 3.31List the chemical elements that make up fats.2Listthreefunctions of fats.3Describe how you would test for fats in a food sample.Let’s Practise 3.2How has our opinion of eating eggs changed over time? In the past, eggswere considered bad for our health and we were discouraged from eatingmore than two per week. Now, eggs are considered by some nutritionists asthe “perfect food”. They are believed to contain all the necessary nutrientsthat are good for our growth and maintenance of the body (Figure 3.20).Eggs also contain cholesterol, which is a type of lipid.What about the discussion on cholesterol intake? Is the amount ofcholesterol found in our blood determined by how much cholesterol wetake in from food? Or is cholesterol manufactured by our bodies fromother types of nutrients? Are all forms of cholesterol bad for our health?Our knowledge of nutrients, and the roles they play in our lives, keepsmaturing as we gain a better understanding of how our bodies function.What attitudes should we embrace as we continue to explore this topicand discover more insights on food and nutrients? How should we behavewhen these insights from the latest research studies contradict what wethought we knew about the topic?"
How Can We Test for Proteins?,"Proteins can be detected by the biuret test. Thebiuret solutionis a blue solution madeup of sodium hydroxide and copper(II) sulfate. It turns violet (deep purple) whenproteins are present.AimTo test for the presence of proteins in a food sample (e.g. egg white) using biuret solutionProcedure1To 2 cm3of liquid food sample (e.g. eggwhite), add an equal volume of biuretsolution.2Shake well and allow the mixture to standfor five minutes.3Record your observation."
How Can We Test for Reducing Sugars?,"Glucose, fructose and maltose are also known asreducing sugars. Reducingsugars will produce a red precipitate when boiled with Benedict’s solution(refer to Let’s Investigate 3.1). Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar and will notgive a red precipitate with this test.AimTo test for the presence of reducing sugars in different food samplesusing Benedict’s solutionProcedure1Place 2 cm3of each food sample into a test-tube (Figure 3.6).2Add 2 cm3of Benedict’s solution to the food sample (Figure 3.7).3Shake the mixture and place the test-tube in a boiling water-bathfor 2–3 minutes (Figure 3.8).4Record the colour of the solution."
How Can We Test for Starch?,Starch can be detected by the iodine test. A few drops ofiodine solutiontoany substance containing starch will produce a blue-black colour.
How Did Cells Get Their Name?,"The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He namedthe boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact,Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells."
How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?,"A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane.Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and amixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolvedsubstances to pass through.A plant cell behaves differently from an animalcell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due tothe presence of the cell wall in plant cells."
How Does an Enzyme Work?,"Enzymes are highly specific in their action. For example, amylases onlyact on starch, and not on proteins or fats. Similarly, proteases act only onproteins, and lipases only on fats. Thisenzyme specificitymeans that eachchemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by a unique enzyme."
Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories,"All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks.Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells aschemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keepyou alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials.• Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts ofthe body.In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell alsohas different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondriaprovide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division oflabour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and performits role within the body."

Osmosis,"The cell membrane is apartially permeable membrane.It allowssome substances to pass through but not others.Figure 2.15 shows thetwo arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane.This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrosemolecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar.29"

The following points in Let’s Investigate 3.5 are worth noting.ABCScan the QR code toexplore a simulationon testing fornutrients."
Proteins,"Proteinsare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen,oxygen and nitrogen. Another element, sulfur, may also be present.Proteins are always present in all cells. Their molecules are the largest andmost complicated of all the food substances. Proteins arecommonly found in the meat of animals (Figure 3.21).Figure 3.21Fish meat contains proteins.There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids, for example,methionine and valine. They differ because of their differentRgroups.Amino acids are combined in various ways to form millions of differentprotein molecules, just as the 26 letters of the alphabet can be used toform a very large number of words."
Ribosomes,Ribosomesare small round structures. They are either attached to themembrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or lie freely in the cytoplasm(Figure 1.6 on page 5). They are needed to synthesise proteins in the cell.• The ribosomes attached to the RER make proteins that are usuallytransported out of the cell.• The ribosomes lying freely in the cytoplasm make proteins that are usedwithin the cytoplasm of that cell.The RER transports proteins made by ribosomes to the Golgi body forsecretion out of the cell.
Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum,"Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)consistsof a network of flattened spaces lined with amembrane (Figure 1.9). (Greek:endoplasm= withinthe cytoplasm;reticulum= network).• Its surface appears rough when viewed under theelectron microscope. This is because small particles calledribosomes are attached to its outer surface (Figure 1.10).• The outer surface of the RER is continuous with the nuclear membrane.Figure 1.9Three-dimensionaldiagram ofendoplasmicreticulummembrane linedwith ribosomesFigure 1.10Colourisedelectron micrograph ofmembrane lined withribosomesFigure 1.7Diagram showing parts of the nucleus (three-dimensional reconstruction of images seen under anelectron microscope)To see the individual parts of the nucleus clearly, we will need to use anelectron microscope (Figure 1.7).Chromosomes• Each chromosome is a longthread-like structure found withinthe nucleus. (A human cell contains46 chromosomes.)• It is made up of proteins and acompound called deoxyribonucleicacid or DNA. Hereditary informationis stored in DNA. DNA carriesinstructions that a cell needs forcarrying out its activities.• When the cell is dividing, thechromosomes condense and shortento become thick, rod-shapedstructures.Nuclearmembraneseparates thecontents of thenucleus fromthe rest of thecytoplasm.Figure 1.8 shows the appearance ofchromosomes during cell division.chromosomesFigure 1.8Highly magnified (25 000x)and colourised electron micrograph ofchromosomes during cell division"
Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum,Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)does not have ribosomes attachedto its membrane. SER is more tubular than RER (see Figure 1.11). It isconnected to the RER.The SER:• synthesises substances such as fats andsteroids(sex hormonesin mammals are steroids)• converts harmful substances into harmless substances througha process known asdetoxification
Sugars,"Sugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they willlower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy todo work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3).Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cellmembranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars areglucoseandfructose(refer to Table 3.1).They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms arearranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangementsgive the sugars different chemical and biological properties.Table 3.1Occurrence of single sugarsSingle SugarOccurrenceGlucoseFound in plantsand animalsFructoseCommon in plants,but rare in animals"
Surface Area-to-volume Ratio,"What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of manysmall cells and not just one large cell?The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across thecell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cellmembrane fast enough to stay alive.The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cellmembrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one withthe larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surfacearea and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential conceptin biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at whichsubstances move in and out of it.The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios."
Their Functions?,"Learning Outcome• Explain how the structures of specialised cells are adapted to their functions (e.g. muscle cell –many mitochondria to supply more energy, root hair cell – large surface area of cell membranefor greater absorption, red blood cell – lack of nucleus allowing it to transport more oxygen).There are many different types of cells in living organisms. These cells differ in size and shapeand they perform specific functions. For example:• the human body has liver cells, nerve cells and skin cells, and• the bougainvillea plant has guard cells and root hair cells.A nerve cell looksvery different from thegeneralised cell you havelearnt.

Three-dimensional Shape,"Many amino acid molecules are joined in a linear manner to form apolypeptide. Polypeptides in turn may be linked up to form an even longerchain of amino acids. A protein molecule is made up of one or more suchchains folded together (Figure 3.22). In most proteins, the polypeptidechains are folded into a more complex, three-dimensional shape.Figure 3.22Amino acids are joined to form polypeptides, which link up to formeven longer chains of amino acids."
Unchanged at the End of Reactions,"Enzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in thereactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over andover again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reactionfor a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washingpowder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing."
Vacuoles,"Avacuoleis a fluid-filled space enclosed by apartially permeable membrane. Vacuoles storesubstances within the cell.Plant cells have a large central vacuole whichcontains a liquid called cell sap.Cell sapcontainsdissolved substances such as sugars, mineral saltsand amino acids.Animal cells have many small vacuoles thatcontain water and food substances. Thesevacuoles usually exist temporarily.stack of membranes containing chlorophyll(b)Colourised electronmicrograph of a sectionof a chloroplast"
Water Potential?,"When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, watermolecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside thecell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause itto lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23).This process is calledcrenation. An animal cell will become dehydratedand eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.Figure 2.22A plant cell in a solution with lower water potentialFigure 2.23An animal cell in a solution with lower water potentialBy osmosis, watermolecules fromthe vacuole andcytoplasm leavethe cell through thepartially permeablecell membrane.2placed in asolution oflower waterpotentialAs the cell loses water, thevacuole decreases in size. Thecytoplasm shrinks away fromthe cell wall. The shrinkageof cytoplasm and cellmembrane away from the cellwall is calledplasmolysis.The cell is said to beplasmolysed. A plasmolysedcell can be restored to itsoriginal state by placing it inwater or in a solution withhigher water potential.4The cell decreasesin size and becomesflaccid orlimp.3When a plant cell isimmersed in a solutionwith lower waterpotential, the cell saphas a higher waterpotential than thesolution outside the cell.1plant cellcell sap in vacuole"
What Are Complex Carbohydrates?,"A complex carbohydrate is made up of many similar molecules of singlesugar joined together to form a large molecule.Starch, glycogen and cellulose are complex carbohydrates made up ofnumerous glucose molecules. The glucose molecules are linked in differentways, giving rise to different structures. Hence, starch, glycogen andcellulose have different chemical and biological properties. They also havedifferent roles as shown in Table 3.3."
What Are the Functions of Carbohydrates?,"Carbohydrates are needed:• as a substrate for respiration, to provide energy for cell activities;• to form supporting structures, for example, cell walls in plants;• to be converted into other organic compounds such as amino acidsand fats;• for the formation of nucleic acids, for example, DNA;• to synthesise lubricants, for example, mucus, which consists of acarbohydrate and a protein; and• to synthesise the nectar in some flowers.Nectaris a sweet liquid thatplants produce to attract insects."
What Are the Functions of Fats?,"How are some animals able to survive in cold climate, while others are notable to? What are the features common to these animals? How do thesefeatures help them to survive in the cold?Fats function as:• A source and a long-term storage of energy.– They are a suitable long-term storage material because fats have ahigher energy value compared to carbohydrates.• An insulating material that prevents excessive heat loss. For example,animals such as seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) beneath the skin,which helps to reduce loss of body heat (Figure 3.18).• A solvent for fat-soluble vitamins and many other vital substances suchas hormones.• An essential part of cells, especially in cell membranes.• A way to reduce water loss from the skin surface. Glands in the skinsecrete an oily substance.– This oily substance forms a thin layer over the skin surface, reducingthe rate of evaporation of water.– The oily substance also reduces the rate of heat loss from the skin.Figure 3.17Examples of food rich in fatsEnergyFats are one of the energystores of animals. Theyare required by livingorganisms to carry outlife processes."
What Are the Functions of Proteins?,"Proteins are used in the:• synthesis of new cytoplasm, for growth and repairof worn-out body cells;• synthesis of enzymes and some hormones; and• formation ofantibodiesto combat diseases.Figure 3.23Examples of plant and animal proteinsChemistryWe learn that apolymer is a type ofmacromolecule formedby many small unitscalled monomerslinked together."
What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?,"The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6).Eachorganelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of theseorganelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body,mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.Figure 1.6Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscopeNucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called thenuclear membrane. Thenucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You willlearn more about chromosomes later in this section.These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cellsof a mammal, are unable to divide."
What Are the Sources of Fats?,"• Foods that are rich in fats include butter, cheese, fatty meat, olives,many nuts, peas, beans, seeds of castor oil and palm oil (Figure 3.17).• The meat of most fishes and ‘white meats’ have relatively less fats.However, some fishes such as herring and salmon have lots of fats.Figure 3.18Seals and polar bears have a thick layer of fat beneath their skin,which helps reduce heat loss."
What Are the Sources of Proteins?,"Proteins can be found in both animal and plant foods. Milk, eggs, seafoodand meat, such as chicken and lean beef,are some animal foods rich inproteins (Figure 3.23). Plant foods rich in proteins include soya beans, nuts,grains and vegetables such as French beans."
What Does a Cell Consist Of?,"Acellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living mattercalled protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similarparts. Each living cell consists of living material calledprotoplasm(Greek:protos= first;plasm= form).Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities thatallow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watcha clip and have a glimpseof the structures insidethe cell."
What Reactions Do Enzymes Catalyse?,"Some food molecules are large and insoluble in water. These moleculescannot diffuse through the cell membrane.Enzymes are required to break these large molecules into simpler andsmaller substances so that they are:• soluble in water• small enough to diffuse through the cell membrane (Figure 4.4)Enzymes that are involved in digestion are known asdigestive enzymes.Examples of digestive enzymes are:• amylase — digests starch to maltose• maltase — digests maltose to glucose• protease — digests proteins to polypeptides, then to amino acids• lipase — digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol"
Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?,"Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining theshape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceousand non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because ofthe turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water lossfrom the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example,changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of thestomata (Figure 2.24).Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will bekilled if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to addtoo much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution willbecome very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the rootsby osmosis.Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporationof water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient wateris added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26)."

to Osmosis?,"• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis.Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules tomove from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lowerconcentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than aconcentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of thedilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions ofdifferent water potentials, a water potential gradient is established(Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher waterpotential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a waterpotential gradient.Figure 2.16Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosisPractical WorkbookExperiment 2BLink"
‘Lock-and-key’ Hypothesis,"The substances on which enzymes act are calledsubstrates. For example,protein is the substrate on which a protease acts.According to the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis, enzyme reactions dependon the presence ofactive sites(Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves(depressions) or ‘pockets’ on the surface of an enzyme molecule into whichthe substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like alock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key.When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, anenzyme–substrate complexis formed. It is a temporary moleculeformed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at theactive site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s).The product molecule(s) separate(s) from the enzyme. The enzymemolecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with moresubstrate molecules.The general equation is:E + SESE + PwhereE= enzymeS= substrate(s)P= product(s).Figure 4.8Three-dimensional model of enzyme pepsin with its active siteactive site (grooveon the protein)Structure andFunctionThe structure of biologicalmolecules affects theirfunctions. For example,the structure of enzymesaffects the substrates thatcan fit into the active site.This affects the reactionsthey catalyse."
