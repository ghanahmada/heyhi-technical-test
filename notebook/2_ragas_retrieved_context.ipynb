Enzyme andsubstrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate moleculescolliding with the enzyme is very low.1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. Therate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding andfitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases therate of enzyme-substrate complex formation.2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active.For most human enzymes, theoptimumtemperature is about 40–45 °C.3\n",

Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease inthe stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinalenzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary fromthe optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity oralkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH ofabout 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) oralkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, theenzyme is completely denatured.\n"

The rate of the substrate moleculescolliding with the enzyme is very low.1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. Therate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding andfitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases therate of enzyme-substrate complex formation.2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active.For most human enzymes, theoptimumtemperature is about 40\\u201345 \\u00b0C.3\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ground_truth\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 191,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"'                          The main difference between the vacuoles in plant cells and animal cells is that plant cells have a large central vacuole containing cell sap, while animal cells have many small vacuoles that usually exist temporarily and contain water and food substances.'\",\n          \"\\\"If you test a food sample that has sucrose with Benedict's solution, you will not see a red precipitate because sucrose is a non-reducing sugar.\\\"\",\n          \"'Starch, glycogen, and cellulose'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This occurs when the enzyme is exposed to high temperatures, pH changes, or other environmental stressors that disrupt the delicate balance of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that maintain its native conformation. As a result, the enzyme's active site is altered, and it can no longer bind to its substrate or facilitate the desired chemical reaction. Denaturation is often reversible, meaning that under the right conditions, the enzyme can refold and regain its native structure and function.
